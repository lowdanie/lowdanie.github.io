My name is Daniel Lowengrub.

In this blog I try to summarize what I'm currently learning - both to
crystallize my understanding and as a resource to other people that may be
interested. If you have comments or questions about anything on this site I'd
love to hear from you! Feel free to send me an email at
[lowdanie@gmail.com](mailto:lowdanie@gmail.com).

I currently work as a software engineer. My
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-lowengrub-bb43a296/) contains more
information. Prior to that I was a mathematics graduate student at UC Berkeley.
You can see some of my academic work
