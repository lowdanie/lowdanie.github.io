My name is Daniel Lowengrub. Currently I’m working as a software engineer in the Autonomous Vehicle industry.
Prior to this I was a mathematics graduate student at UC Berkeley.
You can see some of my academic work [here](https://math.berkeley.edu/~lowdanie/).

In this blog I try to summarize interesting pieces of mathematics which have applications to computer science and physics.
