# Introduction

A fundamental challenge in
[quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) is to find
problems for which there is a
[quantum algoritm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm) that is
significantly (i.e more than polynomially) faster than the best known classical
algorithm.

One of the most impactful examples of this is [Shor's Algorithm] for
[integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization).
The significance of this problem is due to
